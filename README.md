Read out Foxess T-Series Inverter to Home Assistant by using ESPHome

Compatibale with:
- Foxess T-series


Instructions:

- Fill out individual data in the YAML file (SSID, password, manual ip, etc.)
- Optionally comment sensors you don't need or uncomment sensors you do need

The hardware setup including a wiring diagramm can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/assembly12/Foxess-T-series-ESPHome-Home-Assistant/wiki/Hardware-setup).

Designing a custom pcb and enclosure is next on my to do list. I'll update here with the corresponding gerber and stl files when done.

There is some more info being send (like error messages and so on), however this is really not to usefull so I left it out of this component.

Some basic electronics skills (like soldering) are needed to realize this project. I do not take any responsibility for the use of this custom component or anything that it written down in this repository. Use at your own risk.
